# Echomate Backend Development - MVP Task List

## üîê Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization (AWS Cognito)
- [ ] **1.1 Set Up AWS Cognito User Pool**
  - [ ] Configure user pool with email/password authentication (using Amplify Library for cost-effective token handling)
  - [ ] Set up required user attributes (email, name, etc.)
  - [ ] Configure password policies and security settings

- [ ] **1.2 Implement Authentication Flow**
  - [ ] Set up sign-up, sign-in, and password reset flows via Amplify
  - [ ] Use Cognito's built-in JWT handling (no extra cost)

- [ ] **1.3 Authorization Setup**
  - [ ] Use the free, built-in Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway

## üì¶ Phase 2: Database Design & Implementation (DynamoDB)
- [ ] **2.1 User Table Design**
  - [ ] Define schema with nested JSON for profile flexibility
  - [ ] Plan for partial updates using `UpdateExpression` for efficiency
  - [ ] Set table to **On-Demand capacity** to only pay for what you use

- [ ] **2.2 Posts & Interactions Tables**
  - [ ] Define schemas for Posts and Likes/Interactions
  - [ ] Set tables to **On-Demand capacity** for cost control

## üîÑ Phase 3: API Development (Lambda & API Gateway)
- [ ] **3.1 User & Post Management APIs**
  - [ ] Create Lambda functions for all CRUD operations
  - [ ] Keep function code small and dependencies minimal to reduce cold starts
  - [ ] Avoid placing functions in a VPC unless essential

- [ ] **3.2 Lambda Versioning**
  - [ ] Use free Lambda aliases (`prod`, `staging`) for version management

## üì∏ Phase 4: Media Storage (S3)
- [ ] **4.1 S3 Bucket Setup**
  - [ ] Configure bucket policies to deny public access by default
  - [ ] Set up CORS for your frontend domain

- [ ] **4.2 Secure Media Upload System**
  - [ ] Implement pre-signed URLs generated by Lambda for secure, low-cost uploads
  - [ ] Validate file size and type in frontend and Lambda (free)

## üîí Phase 5: Security Implementation
- [ ] **5.1 API Security**
  - [ ] Use API Gateway's built-in throttling (free) for rate limiting
  - [ ] Avoid AWS WAF for now to save on fixed monthly costs

- [ ] **5.2 Data Security**
  - [ ] Use default encryption for DynamoDB and S3 (free)
  - [ ] Set up a billing alarm in CloudWatch to monitor costs (free)

## üöÄ Phase 7: Deployment
- [ ] **7.1 Frontend Deployment**
  - [ ] Choose a host with a generous free tier (Vercel or Netlify recommended)
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD through their GitHub integration

- [ ] **7.2 Backend Deployment**
  - [ ] Deploy Lambda and API Gateway updates via AWS CLI or simple GitHub Actions scripts

## üìà Phase 8: Launch & Maintenance
- [ ] **8.1 Monitoring**
  - [ ] Use CloudWatch Dashboards and Alarms (within the free tier) to monitor key metrics
  - [ ] Focus on billing alarms, Lambda errors, and API Gateway latency

- [ ] **8.2 Pre-launch Testing**
  - [ ] Perform rigorous manual testing instead of paid load-testing services
  - [ ] Ask friends to help test to simulate concurrent users for free
